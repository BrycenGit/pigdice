## Description

Pig Dice
Write a program where two users can play Pig dice against each other. Don't forget to write plain English specifications with example inputs and outputs before you begin coding!

Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold":

If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.

If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.

If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.

The first player to score 100 or more points wins.

Further Exploration
Add options to play one of the other variations of Pig Dice using two or more dice
Add option to play the computer - easy or hard levels:
Easy: Computer always stops after second roll.
Hard: Computer uses strategy based on current total and rolled dice.
