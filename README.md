## Description

Pig Dice ðŸŽ²
Write a program where two users can play Pig dice against each other. D

- Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold":

- If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.

- If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.

- If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.

- The first player to score 100 or more points wins.
